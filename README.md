# genome-mapping-analysis
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing genomic data from SAM files, focusing on mapping reads and filtering genes based on mapping quality and coverage.
## Description

This project provides a set of tools to:
- Extract mapping information from SAM files
- Summarize total mapped reads for each gene
- Filter genes based on mapping quality and coverage thresholds

## Installation

To run the scripts, you need Python 3 and the following Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `pysam`

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas pysam
